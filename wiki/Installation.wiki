It must be done in 3steps:


*Module installation*
 * download latest version of modules1.bas from donwload page

 * if you want to create the form by yourself, select INSERT instead:

 * please remember that form must have properties shown in picture below:

It must contain 4 labels: two are used to simulate progress bars, two to display percentage.


*Folder creation*
 * create on your hard disk a folder which will contain all your attachments
 * in the VBA editor, look for *RootFolder* in the text, and change its value to the path of the folder


Now the macro is installed on your system.
To test if it is properly working, close "VBA editor" window and get back to outlook, press ALT+F8: you should see listed macros "StripAttachments_Explorer" and "ShowFolderName". 

A final step is required: you have to *specify how outbox folder is named* in your language: look for SENT_FOLDER_NAME in the macro text in VBA editor, and change it to that name; to know the exact name of the folder, just select a message in the folder itself, and start the macro named *ShowFolderName*
