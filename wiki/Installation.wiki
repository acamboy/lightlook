It must be done in 3steps:

 * load module1.bas  (download page: http://code.google.com/p/lightlook/downloads/list )


*Form installation*
 * right click on *form* and select *import from file*
 * load frmProgress.frm file (download page: http://code.google.com/p/lightlook/downloads/list )


*Folder creation*
 * create on your hard disk a folder which will contain all your attachments
 * in the VBA editor, look for *RootFolder* in the text, and change its value to the path of the folder


Now the macro is installed on your system.
To test if it is properly working, close "VBA editor" window and get back to outlook, press ALT+F8: you should see listed macros "StripAttachments_Explorer" and "ShowFolderName". 

A final step is required: you have to *specify how outbox folder is named* in your language: look for SENT_FOLDER_NAME in the macro text in VBA editor, and change it to that name; to know the exact name of the folder, just select a message in the folder itself, and start the macro named *ShowFolderName*

See dedicated help page to figure out how to use the macro --> [Usage instructions]
