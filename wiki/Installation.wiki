#summary Installation instructions

It must be done in 3steps:


*Module installation*
 * download latest version of modules1.bas from donwload page
 * start outlook
 * press ALT+F11 to open "VBA editor"
 * press CTRL+R to show project panels on the left (if not already visible)
 * right click on *modules* and select *import from file*
 * load module1.bas


*Form installation*
 * right click on *form* and select *import from file*
 * load frmProgress.frm file


*Folder creation*
 * create on your hard disk a folder which will contain all your attachments
 * in the VBA editor, look for *RootFolder* in the text, and change its value to the path of the folder


*Specify sent folder*

You'll also need to specify how your outbox folder is named in your language: look for SENT_FOLDER_NAME in the macro text in VBA editor, and change it to that name; to know the exact name of the folder, just select a message in the folder itself, and start the macro named *ShowFolderName*



Now the macro is installed on your system.
To test if it is properly working, close "VBA editor" window and get back to outlook, press ALT+F8: you should see listed macro "StripAttachments_Explorer". 

See dedicated help page to figure out how to use the macro --> [Usage instructions]
